# Uno Chefs

## Overview

**Uno Chefs** is a modern, interactive recipe app built to show what Uno Platform can really do in a real-world, production-ready application.

With Uno Chefs, you can dive into a world of cooking inspiration! Register, log in, and start exploring recipes with step-by-step instructions and video tutorials. You’ll be able to check nutritional info through charts, check reviews, favorite your top picks, and filter results to match your taste.

But there’s more! You can discover contributors and their creations, see who’s cooking nearby on an interactive map, build your own personalized cookbooks, check notifications, and access the settings page.
