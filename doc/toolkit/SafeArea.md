# Adapting to Safe Area on Mobile

## Problem

In a mobile platform context, UI elements can be obscured by device-specific features like status bars, rounded corners, notches, or soft-input panels like on-screen keyboards. Certain content, such as readable text or interactive controls, needs to stay within the visible screen area to ensure usability.

## Solution

```xml
<utu:AutoLayout utu:SafeArea.Insets="VisibleBounds"
                Orientation="{utu:Responsive Normal=Vertical, Wide=Horizontal}">
```
