# How to call an ICommand in XAML when the control has no Command property

## Problem

Current controls may not always provide a `Command` property to bind to an `ICommand` in XAML. This can make it difficult to invoke commands in response to user interactions such as when a `TextBox`/`PasswordBox` enter key is pressed, a `ListViewBase`'s `ItemClick` is fired, `NavigationView.ItemInvoked`, or an `ItemsRepeater` item is tapped.

## Solution

The `CommandExtensions` class in the Uno Toolkit provides `Command`/`CommandParameter` attached properties for common scenarios.

### PasswordBox Enter Key

[!code-xml[](../../Chefs/Views/LoginPage.xaml#L39-L41)]

> [!TIP]
> Usage on `TextBox`/`PasswordBox` will also cause the keyboard dismiss on enter. Similar to the `InputExtensions.AutoDismiss` behavior, which is explained in the [InputExtensions documentation](xref:Toolkit.Helpers.InputExtensions).

### ItemsRepeater Item Tapped

[!code-xml[](../../Chefs/Views/HomePage.xaml#L142-L143)]
