# How to inject serializer objects as dependencies into your application

## Problem

Accessing the serialized and deserialized representation of an object can be important for dynamic, data-rich applications. Currently, there is no shared abstract contract between serializers for different data formats (JSON, XML, etc.). As such, it can be difficult to inject an abstraction of a serializer object as a dependency into your view models or services.

## Solution

The Uno.Extensions library provides a set of abstractions for serialization and deserialization. This allows you to inject a serializer object as a dependency into your view models or services. The library includes implementations for JSON serialization as well as extension points for creating custom serializers.

### App Startup Configuration

```csharp
public class App : Application
{
    // Code omitted for brevity

    protected async override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs args)
    {
      var builder = this.CreateBuilder(args)
        .Configure(host => host
          // Code omitted for brevity

          // Register Json serializers (ISerializer and ISerializer)
          .UseSerialization()

          // Code omitted for brevity
      );

    // Code omitted for brevity
    }
}
```

### Consume `ISerializer` as dependency in data services

### Notification JSON data (notifications.json)

[!code-json[](../../Chefs/Data/AppData/Notifications.json#L2-L13)]

### NotificationData model object

[!code-csharp[](../../Chefs/Data/Entities/NotificationData.cs#L3-L9)]
